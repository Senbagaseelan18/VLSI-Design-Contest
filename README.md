## 1. About This Repository

This repository serves as the central hub for the **EdgeSight** project for the **39th International Conference on VLSI Design**.  
It is intended to document the complete workflow for developing an FPGA-accelerated AI assistive device, including:

- Tool installation and setup  
- FPGA design using **Libero¬Æ SoC Design Suite**  
- RISC-V firmware development using **SoftConsole IDE**  
- Project idea, design documents, and implementation strategy  
- Booting and running Linux BSP on the PolarFire¬Æ SoC Icicle Kit  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **live, updating repository**. We will continuously update it with design files, simulation results, FPGA bitstreams, and firmware as the project progresses.

---

## 2. Completed Work

So far, the following milestones have been completed:

1. **Tool Installation & Setup Guide**  
   - Installed and configured **Libero¬Æ SoC Design Suite 2025.01**  
   - Installed **SoftConsole IDE 2024.2**  
   - License configuration and environment setup for both tools  

2. **Project Idea & Design Documentation**  
   - Detailed abstract and implementation plan for **EdgeSight**  
   - Block diagrams, vision, audio, navigation, and AI integration concepts  
   - References and related research documentation  

3. **Links to Completed Directories**  
   - [Tool Installation & Setup Guide](./Tool%20Installation%20&%20Setup%20Guide)  
   - [Project Idea & Documentation](./Project%20Idea)  

---

## 3. Current Work

We are currently focused on **booting the PolarFire¬Æ SoC Icicle Kit** with the latest Linux BSP image.  
This will provide a foundation for running the RISC-V firmware, integrating FPGA-accelerated AI models, and testing the EdgeSight system on the actual hardware.

- Linux BSP download and preparation  
- SD card flashing and board verification  
- Initial boot and hardware peripheral checks
